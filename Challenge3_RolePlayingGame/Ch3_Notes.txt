* JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM => tree of objects representing the HTML.
* This HTML can be accessed by using the 'document' object.

* document.querySelector("CSS-Selector") - method for finding specific elements in your HTML.
    - Takes a CSS Selector as arg and then returns the first element which matches that selector.

* Background button transition :-

    button {
        ...
        background-image: linear-gradient(var(--btn-gradient1), var(--btn-gradient2));
        ...
    }

* object.onclick = to determine the action to occur when that object is 'clicked'.
* object.innerText = controls the text that appears in an HTML element.
