* Key point in event-listener definition : 
    a)  rockBtn.addEventListener('click', showResults("Rock");
            - Here the function executes immediately, when the script runs, as the return value of that function gets assigned to the event-listener, when the script executes.
            - Reason : function itself is being called, instead of being passed as a reference.
    
    b)  rockBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
            showResults("Rock")
        });
            - Here the function is being passed as a reference. 
            - Hence acts as an anonymous callback function & inner-function gets triggered (called) only when the 'click' event occurs.

    Alternative with arrow function : 
    rockBtn.addEventListener('click', () => showResults("Rock"));
